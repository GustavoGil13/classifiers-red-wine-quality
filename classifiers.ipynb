    "1. **fixed acidity**: most acids involved with wine or fixed or nonvolatile (do not evaporate readily)\n",
    "2. **volatile acidity**: the amount of acetic acid in wine, which at too high of levels can lead to an unpleasant, vinegar taste\n",
    "3. **citric acid**: found in small quantities, citric acid can add 'freshness' and flavor to wines\n",
    "4. **residual sugar**: the amount of sugar remaining after fermentation stops, it's rare to find wines with less than 1 gram/liter\n",
    "5. **chlorides**: the amount of salt in the wine\n",
    "6. **free sulfur dioxide**: the free form of SO2 exists in equilibrium between molecular SO2 (as a dissolved gas) and bisulfite ion; it prevents\n",
    "7. **total sulfur dioxide**: amount of free and bound forms of S02; in low concentrations, SO2 is mostly undetectable in wine, but at free SO2\n",
    "8. **density**: the density of water is close to that of water depending on the percent alcohol and sugar content\n",
    "9. **ph**: describes how acidic or basic a wine is on a scale from 0 (very acidic) to 14 (very basic); most wines are between 3-4\n",
    "10. **sulphates**: a wine additive which can contribute to sulfur dioxide gas (S02) levels, which acts as an antimicrobial\n",
    "11. **alcohol sulfur dioxide**: the percent alcohol content of the wine\n",
    "12. **quality**: output variable (based on sensory data, score between 3 and 8) "
